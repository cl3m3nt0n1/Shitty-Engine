###### Notes
Don't hesitate to use this small work for your own projects. 

I did not include any of the resources. Even though I made the SFX and arts myself I didn't create any of the rest (fonts and music) and I do not want to redistribute the work of others. 
Here are the fonts and music I used for the game : 
- Font : [Kaph ](https://ggbot.itch.io/kaph-font)- Made by [GGBotNet](https://www.ggbot.net/)
- Music : [amiga.mod](https://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&query=33453)
